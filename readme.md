## K64F Current Control
##### Current Control of DC Motor Experiment
`by Shenggao Li, Patrick Wensing, and Paul Rumbach`

This is a repo of some template codes for the students who take the course [AME30358 - Mechatronics Lab](https://www3.nd.edu/~prumbach/ame30358/) at University of Notre Dame.

This repo contains a _Keil Studio_ project that implement a proportional current controller. It also includes serval Matlab scripts that support the communication between FRDM board and PC.

You can find more details on the home page [AME30358 - Mechatronics Lab](https://www3.nd.edu/~prumbach/ame30358/).
